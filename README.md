Working with massive DataFrames in a standard IDE can be cumbersome and restrictive. [InteractiveDataViewer] bridges the gap between Python's analytical power and Excel's intuitive interface. By leveraging the [xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/) library, this tool allows you to seamlessly push, manipulate, and explore your data in a familiar spreadsheet environment without losing your Python workflow.
